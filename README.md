Musicly's Mode.ify is a web app designed for musicians to write more complex chords and progesssions, making their music more interesting, and invoke more emotion.

The main feature is a piano that can be played on your computer keyboard, with a chord builder and chord progression builder, and several suggestion modes that suggest more complex chords, or chords that fit within the key you're in.

## Inspiration

Music theory is HARD. There are over 4,000 recognized chords before we even get into voicings. There are 168 scales to choose from. This leads to a nearly infinite number of possibilities, yet we tend to hear a lot of the same chord progressions again and again.
